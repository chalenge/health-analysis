Analyzing Public Health Data to study patterns and outcomes of patient hospital visits at a Massachusetts hospital from 2006 to 2008

Our objective in this project is to study patterns and outcomes of patient hospital visits at a Massachusetts hospital from 2006 to 2008. Health care reform in Massachusetts passed in 2006, and our team was curious to see what post-reform trends and patterns in hospital usage we could uncover, if any.
